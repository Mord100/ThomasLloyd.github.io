      Abstract Does imperfect memory prevent people from fully learning about their imperfect self-control? Using data from a field experiment on exercise, we document that people have inflated recall of past gym attendance. Larger overestimation of past attendance is associated with (i) more overestimation of future attendance, (ii) a lower willingness to pay to motivate higher future gym attendance, and (iii) higher expectations of attaining desired future attendance. We structurally estimate how present focus and naivete vary with recall bias. Higher recall bias is not associated with actual present focus, but is strongly associated with naivete about present focus.
