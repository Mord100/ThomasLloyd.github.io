      Do biases in memory help to explain failures to fully recognize self-control problems (i.e., partially naive present focus)? We use data from a field experiment on gym members and document that on average people have slightly inflated past recall of prior visit patterns. Those with more inflated memories of past visits are more overconfident about their future visit rates and display lower willingness-to-pay to use incentives to change their future behavior. We estimate a structural model of present focus and find that those with above-median recall errors have similar actual present focus but are significantly more naive about their present focus.
