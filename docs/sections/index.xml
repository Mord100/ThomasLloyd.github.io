      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in understanding how insights from psychology and behavioral economics can inform our understanding and the design of public policies.
I previously worked as a research coordinator in the Business Economics and Public Policy Department at Wharton, and I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at Georgetown University in 2019.
