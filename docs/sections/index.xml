      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a first-year PhD student in the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley. I&amp;rsquo;m generally interested in researching how insights from psychology and behavioral economics can inform our understanding and the design of public policies.
I previously worked as a research coordinator in the Business Economics and Public Policy Department at Wharton, and I completed my undergraduate studies at Georgetown University in 2019.</description>
