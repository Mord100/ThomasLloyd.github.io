<section>
    
<p>I&rsquo;m a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/">Department of Economics</a> at the University of California, Berkeley. I&rsquo;m interested in understanding how insights from psychology and behavioral economics can inform our understanding and the design of public policies.</p>
<p>I previously worked as a research coordinator in the <a href="https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/">Business Economics and Public Policy Department</a> at Wharton, and I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at Georgetown University in 2019.</p>

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">“Designing, not Checking, for Policy Robustness: An Example with Optimal Taxation</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with  Benjamin Lockwood and Matthew Weinzierl)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Tax Policy and the Economy, 2021</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: Economists typically check the robustness of their results by comparing them across plausible ranges of parameter values and model structures. A preferable approach to robustness—for the purposes of policymaking and evaluation—is to design policy that takes these ranges into account. We modify the standard optimal income tax model to include the policymaker’s subjective uncertainty over parameter values, and we characterize robust optimal policy as that which maximizes expected social welfare. After calibrating uncertainty over the elasticity of taxable income from past empirical work and novel survey data on economists’ beliefs, we compare the implied robust optimal marginal tax rates to the alternative benchmark policy based on the best point estimates of relevant parameters. Our results suggest that robust optimal marginal tax rates are typically more progressive than in benchmark analyses, raising top marginal tax rates by between 5 and 7 percentage points, and generating modest expected welfare gains.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/Allcott_Taubinsky_Sial_Lotteries.pdf" target="blank">What Drives Demand for State-Run Lotteries? Evidence and Welfare Implications</a></h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Hunt Allcott, Benjamin B. Lockwood, and Dmitry Taubinsky)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: June 2021</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: We use a series of natural experiments embedded in the administration of state-run lotto games, as well as a new nationally-representative survey linking lottery expenditures to behavioral biases, to provide reduced-form and structural estimates of people’s risk preferences in this domain. In new data on prizes and sales, we find that sales respond more to the expected value of the jackpot than to price, but are unresponsive to variation in the second prize—a pattern that implies probability weighting but is inconsistent with typically-used parameterizations. In our survey, we find that individual-level lottery spending decreases modestly with income and is strongly associated with survey measures of innumeracy, poor statistical reasoning, and other proxies for behavioral bias. These bias proxies decline with income and account for 43 percent of lottery purchases. This suggests that the measured probability weighting is at least in part due to biases rather than wishful thinking, entertainment utility, or other “non-standard” preferences. We illustrate the policy relevance of the empirical estimates by setting them in a model of optimal lottery design. In the model, current multi-state lottery designs increase welfare but may harm heavy-spending low-income people.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Biased Memory and Perceptions of Self-Control</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Justin Sydnor and Dmitry Taubinsky)</p>




<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: Do biases in memory help to explain failures to fully recognize self-control problems (i.e., partially naive present focus)? We use data from a field experiment on gym members and document that on average people have slightly inflated past recall of prior visit patterns. Those with more inflated memories of past visits are more overconfident about their future visit rates and display lower willingness-to-pay to use incentives to change their future behavior. We estimate a structural model of present focus and find that those with above-median recall errors have similar actual present focus but are significantly more naive about their present focus.
