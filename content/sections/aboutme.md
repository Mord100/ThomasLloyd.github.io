I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I'm generally interested in researching how insights from psychology and behavioral economics can inform how we design and understand the effects of public policies.

I previously worked as a research coordinator in the [Business Economics and Public Policy Department](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/) at Wharton, and I completed my undergraduate studies at Georgetown University in 2019.
