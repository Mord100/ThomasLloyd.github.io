I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm interested in understanding how insights from psychology and behavioral economics can inform our understanding and the design of public policies.

I previously worked as a research coordinator in the [Business Economics and Public Policy Department](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/) at Wharton, and I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at Georgetown University in 2019.
